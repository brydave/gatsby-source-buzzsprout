      '<p><b>0:30</b> My guest today: web developer and ACTIVE CODING BOOTCAMP student, Laura Pinell. Talkin bout bootcamps and what you need to know if you‚Äôre thinking about starting down that path. Peep all of Laura\'s work at <a href="https://github.com/lapinell">her GitHub</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/lapinell">Instagram</a>.</p><p><b>2:00</b> What I‚Äôm working on currently ‚Äî still plugging away at the same project at work, but I JUST launched my podcast site ‚Äî <a href="https://chancethedev.com">chancethedev.com</a> ‚Äî and am working on enhancing it and making changes to it as we speak. Just started building out a React frontend for it. Project will be in my <a href="https://github.com/chancestrickland">Github</a> for those who want to follow along.</p><p><b>3:35</b> #prettycool</p><p><b>3:40</b> Laura talks about what software bootcamp is like (and why her brain is fried)</p><p><b>4:45</b> Why bootcamp when you were already working as a web dev?</p><p><b>8:32</b> What personality types are well-suited for bootcamps, and why some people might NOT be the right fit. The key is passion and drive.</p><p><b>11:30</b> The most important thing Laura has learned so far at bootcamp ‚Äî people skills. Coding is great, but you gotta work with the people.&nbsp;</p><p><b>14:45</b> How Laura uses UX personas to target potential employers</p><p><b>16:30</b> How working another job before coding can actually help you be a better employee as a coder.</p><p><b>17:00</b> Remote work ‚Äî sorry homies, you still have to work with people and hone those people skills.</p><p><b>18:40</b> Laura‚Äôs advice for people considering bootcamp? Understand that this is a BOOT CAMP. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs hardcore, get ready and don‚Äôt complain about it. Dedicate yourself wholly for a few months and you‚Äôll succeed.</p><p><b>21:20</b> This week I learned some cool command line stuff from Ahmad Awais, a Pakistan-based developer and AMAZING open-source software contributor. If you don‚Äôt follow him, DO IT NOW. Get all of his social links and peep his blog <a href="https://ahmadawais.com/">on his website</a></p><p><b>23:00</b> This week Ahmad taught me how to write a few basic helpful bash scripts to make my command life a little bit easier. Check out his posts on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6370376216167411712">here</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6371342592390549504">here</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6371338537039646720">here</a>. And check out <a href="https://goo.gl/RkpaCs">my script to quickly CD into working WP theme directory here</a>.</p><p><b>25:30</b> Next episode will be a mini-episode including a recorded talk I gave at a recent event on accessibility in web design. CAN‚ÄôT WAIT.</p><p>Follow me on all the things @chancethedev. <a href="https://twitter.com/chancethedev">twitter.com/chancethedev</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/chancethedev">instagram.com/chancethedev</a> and <a href="https://chancethedev.com">chancethedev.com</a> KTHX.</p>',

I truly don't know what I'm doing here, but my hope is to share what I've learned about this exciting and amazingly fun career of mine, and in the process I hope to learn a ton from you and the folks I encounter along the journey.
